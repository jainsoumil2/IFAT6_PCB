TCL Commands to Review Timing Exceptions (Timing Constraints) in Vivado (Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Using Constraints, UG903, (v2023.2) November 1, 2023, Pg. 75-76):

report_methodology
	The methodology check XDCB-1 reports the timing constraints
	that reference large collections of objects (over 1000).

report_exceptions
 	The report exception command () provides coverage and collision
	information on the timing exceptions that have been defined.

AMD recommends that you carefully analyze the following reports:

report_exceptions -scope_override
	This report provides the list of scoped timing constraints that a top-level timing constraint
	partially or totally overrides. However, it does not report a scoped constraint overriden by
	another scoped constraints (from the same scope or from a different scope). For example, this
	option can be used to verify that the IP constraints are not overriden by some user's top-level 
	constraints.

report_exceptions –coverage
	This report provides a logical path coverage for each timing exception. The number of objects
	passed to the timing exception are compared to the number of startpoints and endpoints
	effectively covered. You should review constraints that have significant differences between
	the number of objects and the number of startpoints/endpoints.

report_exceptions –ignored
	This report provides the list of timing constraints overridden by other timing constraints (for
	example, a set_false_path overridden by set_clock_group). You should review the
	overridden constraints for correctness or remove the useless constraints.

report_exceptions –ignored_objects
	This report provides the list of startpoints and endpoints that are ignored due to, for example,
	inexistent paths from those startpoints or to those endpoints.
