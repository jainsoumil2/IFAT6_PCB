 * For both okClk and okClks, establish a new interface of the clock_rtl type and
   set their FREQ_HZ parameter to 100800000 Hz. This enables automatic frequency
   propagation in the IPI block designer.
 * Fixed an issue where using capital hexadecimal address values would trigger the error
   message: 'Named port connection 'xyz' does not exist.'

FrontPanel Subsystem IP Version 1.0 (Rev. 3)
 2023-08-21
 * Minor GUI changes
 * Add closing "`default_nettype wire" directive to several example
   design files that also implement "`default_nettype none" at the
   beginning of the file. This modification addresses potential errors
   encountered with our encrypted FrontPanel HDL files, such as the
   "[Synth 8-5809] Error generated from encrypted envelope" error.
 * Removed Autofill feature in FrontPanel Vivado IP Core due to Vivado IP handling
   changes that started with Vivado version 2022.2; manual endpoint address entry 
   now required.
 * Users are advised not to use prior versions of the FrontPanel Vivado IP Core
   with Vivado versions 2022.2 and onwards. This version of FrontPanel Vivado IP
   Core resolves the following issues in those Vivado versions:
     * Resolves "CRITICAL WARNING: [IP_Flow 19-5622] Failed to create IP instance."
     * Resolves "You cannot have two endpoints with the same address" error in the TCL
       console. The error occurs after pressing "OK" in the GUI, even though the GUI
       did not report these errors initially.
