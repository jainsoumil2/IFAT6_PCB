TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock CLK_DAC/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock mmcm0_clk0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_50M and mmcm0_clk0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_50M] -to [get_clocks mmcm0_clk0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks mmcm0_clk0 and clk_out1_clk_50M are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mmcm0_clk0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_50M]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_clk_50M and mmcm0_clk0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_50M] -to [get_clocks mmcm0_clk0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks mmcm0_clk0 and clk_out1_clk_50M are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks mmcm0_clk0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_50M]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock CLK_DAC/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin CLK_DAC/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
